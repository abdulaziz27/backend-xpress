# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses two critical issues in the current system:
1. Complete the subscription payment flow to allow users to subscribe to different tiers and manage their subscriptions
2. Fix API authentication issues that cause HTML login page responses instead of proper JSON API responses

The system already has basic subscription models and pricing structure, but lacks the complete payment flow and proper API authentication handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Subscription Payment Flow

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want to subscribe to different pricing tiers and manage my subscription, so that I can access the features I need for my business.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views available plans THEN the system SHALL display all active plans with pricing, features, and limits
2. WHEN a user selects a plan THEN the system SHALL initiate a payment process with the correct amount
3. WHEN a user completes payment THEN the system SHALL create an active subscription and grant access to plan features
4. WHEN a user has an active subscription THEN the system SHALL enforce plan limits and feature access
5. WHEN a subscription expires THEN the system SHALL restrict access and notify the user
6. WHEN a user wants to upgrade/downgrade THEN the system SHALL handle plan changes with proper prorating
7. WHEN a user cancels subscription THEN the system SHALL handle cancellation gracefully

### Requirement 2: Fix API Authentication and Response Format

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want to receive proper JSON responses from the API, so that I can integrate with the system without getting HTML login pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated API request is made THEN the system SHALL return a JSON error response instead of HTML login page
2. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with JSON error messages
3. WHEN API requests include proper headers THEN the system SHALL process them as API requests
4. WHEN role/permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL return JSON error responses with clear messages
5. WHEN testing with Postman THEN all endpoints SHALL return JSON responses consistently

### Requirement 3: Subscription Management API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API endpoints to manage subscriptions, so that I can integrate subscription management into the admin interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing subscription endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for subscriptions
2. WHEN retrieving subscription status THEN the system SHALL return current plan, usage, and limits
3. WHEN processing plan changes THEN the system SHALL validate constraints and update accordingly
4. WHEN handling payments THEN the system SHALL integrate with payment providers securely
5. WHEN generating invoices THEN the system SHALL create proper billing records

### Requirement 4: Plan Management and Feature Gates

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage subscription plans and enforce feature access, so that users only access features they've paid for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access features THEN the system SHALL check their subscription plan and limits
2. WHEN plan limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL prevent further usage and suggest upgrades
3. WHEN managing plans THEN the system SHALL allow creating, updating, and deactivating plans
4. WHEN enforcing limits THEN the system SHALL track usage accurately across all features
5. WHEN users approach limits THEN the system SHALL send warnings and upgrade recommendations
